# The Heretic Slackware Wiki

Welcome to the **Heretic Slackware Wiki**, where we break the mold of conventional Linux use. This wiki is for the brave, the curious, and the rebellious Slackware users who seek **unofficial**, **unsupported**, and **unorthodox** ways of tweaking their systems.

Here, youâ€™ll find:
- **Alternative installation methods** that go beyond the handbook.
- **Experimental package management tricks** and custom tools.
- **Kernel hacks, builds**, and tweaks you won't find anywhere else.
- **Non-standard configurations** and **unsupported** software options.

If you're tired of following the beaten path, you're in the right place.

**Disclaimer**: The methods and configurations here are **unofficial** and may void your warranty (if you had one). Proceed with caution!
