# DESKTOP ENVIRONMENTS

Long story! Slackware officially support KDE and XFCE, also some Window Managers.<br>
This happens because Slackware development is almost one mans job. And this is the guaranty of success but also this include some development limits... <br>

As you know every package or SlackBuild is not provided by Patrick Volkerding in theory and in practice is unofficially. <br>
You can find in SBo repo some DE builded by slackers and everything there is good and valid, but most of times is outdated.<br>
That because SBo is always foccused in Slackware stable release which upraded when next release is ready. <br>
That means 1,2...4 yeras... This way you cant maintain a modern DE which upgraded every 6 months or ones per year... <br>


That said, everything you will read from now on is mostly for Slackware-current. Which is what most of us here use...last 100 yers ;)<br>
